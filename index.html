          <p>the international software technology summit</p>
        </div>

        <p>Imagine an invitation-only conference where all the <a href="speakers.html">attendees</a> are practitioners at the top
        of the software industry and are conference speakers themselves. All will present their latest
        ideas during this summit, and all will actively participate in lively, interactive sessions
        where over-the-horizon information technology innovations are presented and discussed.</p>

        <p>speakerconf is that conference!</p>

        <h2>

        <h2>
          <a name="topics" class="anchor" href="#topics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>topics</h2>

        <p>Topics are chosen by the speakers as they see fit. As this is a single-track summit, some speakers adapt their topics based on trending themes. Most presentations have never been given before and may be a year or more away from being given to the general industry. Some are based on confidential research and are shared only with the trusted group of attendees at speakerconf.</p>

        <p>Previous themes have included: the industry's capability levels and software craftsmanship; pragmatic testing; multi-paradigm and polyglot programming; functional programming with TDD and BDD; concurrent and parallel computation; next-generation software development processes and anarchic delivery teams; alternative data repositories; observation and cognition and their affects on our decisions; developers and design; building great software companies; P2P synchronization strategies.</p>

        <p>Those attending speakerconf find it to be a unique, high-quality, invaluable experience.
          They are able to hear about ideas that are poised to transform the IT industry, discuss them in depth with the experts, and take that understanding back to their organizations to gain a competitive advantage.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;<span>speakerconf combines the best features of traditional conferences into an intense few days. At "normal" conferences, the best part is HallwayConf, where you get to talk to other passionate people between formal sessions. speakerconf embraces and formalized this idea, creating an ideational mix that is better than the sum of the parts.</span>&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;<span>You will not find a conference that is better orchestrated than speakerconf. And despite my 15 years of experience in the field, my perspective on programming was radically and durably changed by two times I was fortunate enough to attend there.
